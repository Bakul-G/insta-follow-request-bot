# Instagram Mass Follow Automation

## About the script
For this script, you'll need to supply a CSV file containing the usernames of the accounts you wish to follow. Then, you'll need to enter your own username and password in designated sections of the code. Once that's done, you can sit back and let the code take care of the rest - it will automate the process of logging into Instagram and sending follow requests to each username, regardless of whether it's a personal account or a large brand page. This is all made possible with the help of the Selenium (browser automating tool).
